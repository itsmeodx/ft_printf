# ft_printf
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool :)

## Introduction
For the ft_printf project of the 42 school cursus, we must recreate the famous C library printf function. This project teaches us about variadic arguments as well as structures if we plan to implement printf's extra flags.

- Supported conversions: %, c, s, p, i, d, u, x, X
- Supported flags: # + (space)
- Supported options: - 0 . * width

## Status
Finished: 2022-02-07. Grade: 125/100.

## Usage

``make`` or ``make bonus`` to compile.

### Basic Usage
For example, let's create a ``main.c`` file.
